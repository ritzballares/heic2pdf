# heic2pdf
*heic2pdf* compiles a set of images with the .heic file format into a PDF. I started this project to compile pictures of my solutions in my math class so that I could submit them as a single file (usually during exams/quizzes).

## How to use
1. Clone this repo
2. Install dependencies `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` or `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Put your images with the .heic file extension in the ***images*** folder
4. Run main.py in the root directory `python3 main.py` or `python main.py`
5. Your PDF will have the name *images.pdf* or *image.pdf* if there was only one picture in the *images* directory.
